# Releases (defunct)
This was the place that Kreato Linux releases were in.

Due to additional work that supporting/creating releases have, and personal opinions, Kreato Linux will be now rolling-only.

Plans for Kreato Linux v2.0 stable version are cancelled.

Assets that were used in these versions will be available on our assets repository.

Please report any bugs to [the source tree](https://github.com/kreatolinux/src) instead.
We don't recommend using these versions. They are pretty incomplete and are not compatible with newer versions of packages.
